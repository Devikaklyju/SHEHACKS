                <h3>SWATHY MOHANDAS</h3>
                <p>VISION :<br> 
                    With an unquenchable strive to achieve technical skills and excel in it, I strongly believe SHEHACKS is the perfect platform for me. From exploring the fabulous world of programming languages and much more, I envision myself transforming from a beginner to a professional programmer. SHEHACKS, as I am sure will bring out the best in me, both as a team player and a quick learner to grab those technical skills all at once.
                </p>
                <p>MISSION :<br>
                    To exploit every available resource is my prime goal. Being a dynamic person, throughout the program, I will squeeze every bit of any accessible opportunity before me. My team as a whole will be a great hub of information, as I believe there are a good deal of things that we can learn from one another through which we can grow together. As a team player and an individual, I will endeavour to nurture and flourish my dream.
